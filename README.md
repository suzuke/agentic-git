# agentic-git

**A guarded, transparent `git` for AI coding agents.**

`agentic-git` is a small Rust binary that masquerades as `git` on an agent's
`PATH`. The agent keeps speaking the git it already knows — the shim is
invisible until the moment it matters:

- **routes** every mutating command into the worktree the agent is *bound* to,
- **denies** the operations that wreck multi-agent setups (with an actionable,
  LLM-readable explanation of what to do instead),
- **attributes** every commit to the agent that made it, and
- lets the operator **bypass** any of it, deliberately and audited.

It was extracted from [agend-terminal](https://github.com/suzuke/agend-terminal),
where it has been running a production fleet of coding agents (Claude Code,
Codex, and friends) sharing real repositories on one machine. The full commit
history of the shim came along.

> **Honest positioning:** this is a seatbelt, not a cage. It is a same-uid
> userspace shim aimed at *semi-trusted, accident-prone* agents — a
> prompt-injected or buggy agent is stopped from trashing your checkout by
> habit or mistake; a determined adversary calling `/usr/bin/git` directly is
> not. For a hard boundary you want kernel-level isolation (containers,
> Landlock, sandbox-exec) *underneath* this.

## Why

Coding agents make mistakes at machine speed, and stock git amplifies them:

| Agent habit | Blast radius without a guard |
|---|---|
| `git checkout main` / `git switch <other-branch>` | tramples the branch another agent (or you) is working on |
| `git worktree add/remove` on its own | corrupts the worktree layout your orchestrator manages |
| running git *in your canonical checkout* | detaches or moves **your** HEAD (this really happened; it is why this tool exists) |
| `git push` with a force-added secret | your HMAC key / audit logs leave the machine, irreversibly |
| commits from six agents on one repo | no way to tell who did what |

`agentic-git` enforces the answers at the git layer, instead of hoping every
agent's system prompt says "please be careful".

## How it works

```
agent runs `git <args>`
        │  (PATH: <home>/bin/git → agentic-git)
        ▼
classify(argv, cwd, binding)          binding = HMAC-signed
        │                             agent → branch → worktree
        ├─ passthrough      read-only / safe → exec real git as-is
        ├─ chdir-pass       mutating + bound → exec real git -C <bound worktree>
        ├─ silent-exempt    known tool noise (e.g. gh post-merge) → exit 0
        └─ deny             exit 1 + reason + literal next step for the agent
```

- **Binding:** the orchestrator writes `runtime/<agent>/binding.json`
  (+ `.sig`, HMAC-SHA256 over an operator-owned key). Signature invalid or
  missing → the agent is *unbound* and every mutating command is denied,
  with guidance on how to get a worktree. Fail-closed.
- **Deny matrix** (the interesting cases): `git worktree *` (worktree
  lifecycle belongs to the orchestrator) · `checkout`/`switch` to a different
  or protected branch (`main`/`master` by default, extendable via
  `policy.toml`) · any mutation while unbound (including plumbing:
  `read-tree`, `update-index`, `apply`) · agent git in a canonical-rooted
  repo (protects *your* checkout) · **push ranges carrying trust-root files**
  (`.config-integrity-key`, `policy.toml`, `fleet.yaml`, audit `*.jsonl`) —
  the one place the shim blocks on *content*, because that mistake is
  irreversible.
- **Provenance:** a `prepare-commit-msg` hook (installed per-worktree by the
  orchestrator) appends `Agentic-Agent`, `Agentic-Branch`, `Agentic-Task`,
  `Agentic-Issued-At` trailers, idempotently. A `reference-transaction` hook
  journals every ref move with the agent's identity.
- **Bypass, audited:** `AGENTIC_GIT_BYPASS=1` (one-shot) ·
  `AGENTIC_GIT_BYPASS_AGENT=<name>` (per-agent) ·
  `AGENTIC_GIT_BYPASS_UNTIL=<epoch>` (time-boxed). Bypassed mutations are
  logged to the fleet event log. The deny messages themselves tell the agent
  these exist — transparency over obscurity.
- **Robustness:** recursion guard (a mis-resolved `git` can't spawn-storm
  itself), target-override stripping (a caller's own `-C`/`--git-dir` can't
  out-vote the binding), Unix `exec()` process replacement, Windows
  `status()`+exit.

## Trying it

```sh
cargo build --release

# Simulate what an orchestrator does:
export AGENTIC_GIT_HOME=$HOME/.agentic-git
mkdir -p "$AGENTIC_GIT_HOME/bin"
ln -sf "$PWD/target/release/agentic-git" "$AGENTIC_GIT_HOME/bin/git"

# In the agent's environment (NOT your own shell):
export PATH="$AGENTIC_GIT_HOME/bin:$PATH"
export AGENTIC_GIT_AGENT=my-agent
export AGENTIC_GIT_REAL_GIT="$(command -v git)"   # optional; auto-resolved otherwise

git status          # → passthrough
git checkout main   # → denied, with the reason and the way out
```

Today the *binding* half (leases, worktree provisioning, GC) is the
orchestrator's job — agend-terminal plays that role in the original fleet. A
built-in `agentic-git run --branch <b> -- <agent-cmd>` session mode that
absorbs the minimal provisioning role for standalone use is the top roadmap
item.

## Environment contract

Every variable also accepts its legacy `agend-terminal` name as a fallback,
so an existing agend fleet can adopt this binary with **zero daemon-side
changes**:

| Primary | Legacy fallback | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENTIC_GIT_HOME` | `AGEND_HOME` | state root (bindings, hooks, event log) |
| `AGENTIC_GIT_AGENT` | `AGEND_INSTANCE_NAME` | the calling agent's identity |
| `AGENTIC_GIT_REAL_GIT` | `AGEND_REAL_GIT` | path to the real git binary |
| `AGENTIC_GIT_BYPASS` | `AGEND_GIT_BYPASS` | one-shot bypass |
| `AGENTIC_GIT_BYPASS_AGENT` | `AGEND_GIT_BYPASS_AGENT` | per-agent bypass |
| `AGENTIC_GIT_BYPASS_UNTIL` | `AGEND_GIT_BYPASS_UNTIL` | time-boxed bypass (unix epoch) |
| `AGENTIC_GIT_SHIM_DEPTH` | `AGEND_GIT_SHIM_DEPTH` | recursion-guard sentinel (internal) |
| `AGENTIC_GIT_ALLOW_CANONICAL_MUTATE` | `AGEND_GIT_ALLOW_CANONICAL_MUTATE` | canonical-repo escape hatch |

On-disk contract (also unchanged from upstream): `runtime/<agent>/binding.json`
+ `.sig` · `.config-integrity-key` (32-byte HMAC key, 0600) ·
`fleet_events.jsonl` (append-only audit) · `policy.toml` (optional
protected-ref override, fail-closed) · `.agend-managed` worktree marker.

## Workspace layout

| Crate | What it is |
|---|---|
| `agentic-git` | the shim binary |
| `agentic-git-core` | the contract surface for **embedders**: `integrity_core` (HMAC sign/verify — link this in your daemon and signer/verifier can never drift) and `protected_refs` |

## Status & roadmap

Alpha. Battle-tested logic (the history in this repo is the battle), fresh
packaging. Known rough edges:

- Some deny-message remedies still name agend-terminal MCP tools
  (`bind_self`, `binding_state`) — being generalized.
- No standalone provisioning yet (`run` session mode is the top item).
- Planned next, in order: **session mode** → **pre-destructive-op snapshots**
  (auto-snapshot the worktree into a private ref before `reset --hard` /
  `clean -fdx`, with an operator restore) → richer `policy.toml`.
