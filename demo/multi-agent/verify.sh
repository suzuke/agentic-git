# verify.sh — Layer 1 driver for the multi-agent scenario. The SUPERVISOR owns
# setup and synthesis (both in lib.sh); here it spawns the two guarded agent
# sessions ITSELF, in-process and concurrently, against one shared repo. Then it
# re-derives the truth from git/home/audit STATE (never from an agent's own
# verdict) via the shared synthesize(). An agent that reports PASS but whose
# state disagrees still FAILS.

#
# For the SAME scenario driven by two real agents (each running its own guarded
# session), see live.sh — it reuses lib.sh's build_world + synthesize verbatim.
