#
# It doubles as a cold-start ACCEPTANCE CHECK: every step is asserted, and it
# exits non-zero with a clear FAIL if the shipped binary doesn't actually
# recover the work. If it prints "DEMO PASSED", the tool does what the README
# promises on THIS machine — no git internals required from the viewer.

#
# The framing to keep in mind while watching:
#   a worktree isolates WHERE damage can happen; agentic-git records WHAT was
#   about to be lost — so a `reset --hard` / `clean -fd` is undoable, which
#   plain git cannot offer.
